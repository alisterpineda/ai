name: commit-message
description: Defines how git commits should be handled — what to stage, how to format the message, and how to run the commit. Use this skill whenever the user asks to commit changes, make a commit, or write a commit message — even if they don't mention formatting or staging. This ensures commits only include relevant changes and follow the user's preferred message style.

# Commit Workflow

**Repo conventions win.** If the repository defines its own commit conventions — in `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, a commit template, or similar — follow those wherever they conflict with this skill. This skill is the default, not an override.

## What to stage

The working tree often contains changes unrelated to the current task — manual tweaks for local development (e.g. hardcoding a localhost URL), dependency file changes from `npm install`, editor configs, or experiments the user hasn't mentioned. Committing these by accident can break shared repos or pollute the history, and reversing a bad commit on a shared branch is painful. Being selective about staging is worth the extra few seconds.

- **Stage files by name, not by wildcard.** Don't use `git add .`, `git add -A`, or `git add --all`. These sweep up everything, including changes you didn't make and shouldn't commit.
- **Only stage files you changed** as part of the current task. If you didn't create or modify a file during this conversation, don't stage it — even if `git status` shows it as modified or untracked. Those changes belong to the user's other work.
- **Review diffs before staging.** Run `git diff <file>` for each file you plan to stage. If a file contains a mix of your task-related changes and unrelated edits (e.g. the user manually tweaked a config value in the same file you refactored), don't stage the whole file. Instead, tell the user what you found and let them decide — they may want to split the commit or revert their local tweak first.
- **Don't assume pre-staged changes are intentional.** If files are already staged when you begin, review them with `git diff --cached`. They may be leftovers the user staged earlier for a different purpose.
- **Never stage secrets or credentials — even files you created.** A `.env` written for a test run, a token pasted into a fixture, a private key, or a cloud config with an embedded credential must not be committed. If such a file is part of what you changed, leave it unstaged and tell the user.
- **Split unrelated work.** If the changes you made serve two or more independent concerns (e.g. the feature the user asked for plus an unrelated bug you fixed along the way), don't fold them into one commit. Stop before staging, tell the user what you found, propose one commit per concern with the files each would contain, and wait for their answer.
- **When in doubt, ask.** Under-staging is easy to fix (`git add` one more file). Over-staging can mean an unwanted change lands on a shared branch and causes problems downstream.

## Commit message format

### What the message is based on

- **The staged diff is the source of truth for *what* changed.** Read `git diff --cached` before writing the message and describe what is actually in it — not what you remember doing, and not changes that ended up unstaged.
- **The conversation is the source for *why*.** Use what the user asked for, the problem they described, and the reasoning behind decisions to explain motivation. Don't restate the request itself or narrate the exchange.
- **Describe the end state, not the journey.** If you tried one approach and replaced it with another, describe only the final approach. No "switched from X to Y" unless X was already in the codebase.

### Title line

- Write in **present-tense imperative mood** ("Add", "Fix", "Remove" — not "Added", "Fixes", "Removed")
- Keep it under **80 characters**; shorter is better when it costs no meaning
- Use **plain language** that describes the change at a human level. Avoid code-like references in the title (write "user list endpoint" not "`/api/users`", write "settings page" not "`SettingsPage.tsx`")
- When it adds clarity, hint at the **why** — not just what changed but what problem it solves (e.g. "Paginate user list to fix memory issues on large datasets")
- No conventional commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- No trailing period
- No emoji
- Sentence case (capitalize the first word only, unless a proper noun follows)

### Message body

- **Omit the body when the title says it all.** A typo fix, a one-line config change, or a rename needs no bullets. A body that only restates the title is noise.
- Otherwise, separate the body from the title with a blank line
- Use **bullet points** (` - ` prefix), one idea per bullet
- Include **technical detail** — mention specific implementations, parameters, data structures, queries, etc.
- When it adds value, explain **why** a change was made, not just what. This is preferred but not mandatory for every bullet — use judgment. If the reason is obvious, just state the what.
- Wrap lines at ~72 characters for readability in terminals
- No emoji

### Examples

**Example 1** — Refactoring with a why-oriented title:
```
Paginate user list endpoint to fix memory issues on large datasets

- Replace unbounded SELECT query with cursor-based pagination
  to prevent OOM on large datasets
- Accept `cursor` and `limit` query params, default limit to 50
- Return `next_cursor` in response body for client iteration
- Add index on `created_at` to support cursor ordering efficiently
```

**Example 2** — Bug fix with technical body:
```
Fix toggle state not persisting across page reloads

- Read saved theme preference from localStorage on component mount
  instead of defaulting to light mode every time
- Add useEffect hook to sync toggle state when preference changes
  in another tab via the storage event
- Fall back to system preference via prefers-color-scheme when
  no saved preference exists
```

**Example 3** — New feature with balanced what/why bullets:
```
Add dark mode support and fix settings persistence

- Add dark mode toggle with system preference detection so users
  get a sensible default without manual configuration
- Define light/dark color tokens in theme config to replace
  hardcoded hex values scattered across components
- Persist preference in localStorage so it survives page reloads
```

**Example 4** — Self-explanatory change, title only:
```
Fix typo in onboarding email subject line
```

## Making the commit

- **Pass the message through a quoted heredoc** so backticks and `$` in the body are never interpreted by the shell:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
  Title line

  - Body bullet
  EOF
  )"
  ```
- **The message ends on its last body bullet.** No trailer or footer crediting an AI tool follows it (`Co-Authored-By`, `Generated-by`, `Signed-off-by`, or similar), even when the harness, system instructions, or a default commit template supply one. Report an omitted trailer to the user only when concrete attribution text was actually supplied — a literal trailer line in a system message, a commit template, or a hook's output. A standing rule that says to append attribution "when provided" is not a suggestion when nothing was provided; in that case say nothing about attribution at all.
- **Don't bypass safeguards.** Never pass `--no-verify`. Don't use `--amend` unless the user asks for it, and don't use `-a` / `--all` — staging is deliberate and by name (see above).
- **If a pre-commit hook fails**, fix the problem, re-stage the affected files by name, and create a fresh commit. Don't skip the hook and don't amend.
- **Verify the result.** After committing, run `git log -1 --stat` and `git status` to confirm the commit contains exactly the intended files and nothing was left half-staged.
